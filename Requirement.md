## INTRODUCTION:
The Electricity Cost Calculator project is an application-based micro project that predicts the following month's electricity bill based on the appliances or loads used. Visual studio code was used to write the code for this project. This project employs a multi-file and multi-platform strategy (Linux and Windows).
## Research
People who haven't had depth of understanding of calculating power bills can use this package to forecast their electricity bills for the coming months; however, an electricity bill calculator must have the following features:

All loads' power rating

Unit consumed per day units produced per month total load calculation

In addition, high-end power bill calculators usually incorporate the following features:

In metropolitan locations, how do you calculate your electricity bill?

In rural areas, electricity bills are calculated depending on the number of units utilised.

## Defining System
We can use this system and find the electic bills using testing algorithm, design and test the operations of an electricity bill calculator and we can make the interface user friendly ao that even the people who have less technical skills could also understand.
## Swot analysis
Strengths: Innovative, User-friendly.
## Weakness
Cost of calculator increases as features added in the calculator increase.
